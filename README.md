# Manifesto Technical Challenge
Tasks 1-3  of Manifesto Full-Stack Technical Challenge

#Task 1

# Task 2
An Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Command Line Interface (CLI) application developed in Java. 
## Installation
``` bash
# clone the repository
$ cd <directory>
$ git clone https://https://github.com/ojawolesi/ManifestoTechnicalChallenge.git
# run
$ java -jar ManifestoTechnicalChallenge/target/ManifestoTechnicalChallenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <filepath>
```

## How It Works

The program is a command line application. In order to input entries  for the ATM, you will need to enter them in a .txt file in the format mentioned in the [Technical Challenge brief](https://github.com/ojawolesi/ManifestoTechnicalChallenge/blob/master/Technical%20test%20-%20full%20stack.docx%20(9)%20(2).pdf).

The main function loops through the files line-by-line to validate customer account details and perform basic
operations including balance inquiries and cash withdrawals.
